# Chapter 1: Why AI, Excel, and PowerShell?

Spreadsheets run the world. They're where messy data lives, where reporting gets hacked together, and where millions of people hit the same walls every day: manual cleanups, repetitive formatting, cut-and-paste chaos.

PowerShell is great at automating that. But add AI—and things get smarter.

This book shows you how to bring Excel into the AI era, using tools like:
- **ImportExcel**: build, format, and export Excel files programmatically
- **PSAISuite**: talk to ChatGPT, Claude, and more—right from your terminal
- **PowerShell**: the automation glue holding it all together

We'll show you how to summarize messy sheets, generate reports, transform data, and even build agentic workflows—without leaving the command line.

If you've ever said *"there has to be a better way to do this Excel task..."*—this book is for you.
